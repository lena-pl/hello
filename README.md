# Hello
This is a sweet little project written in Ruby that greets the user and converts their age to seconds

###Features of Interest
I worked on this project during the 2015 Rails Girls Wellington weekend.
**Hello** is a combination of two separate tasks:
1. Greet user: 
..- The user is asked for their name
..- If the name matches the owner (in this case, me), the user is welcomed back, otherwise the user is onformed of the fact that they are unfamiliar to the machine

2. Calculate the user's age in seconds:
..- The user is asked for their age
..- The age is converted into seconds
..- The amount of leap years experienced during the user's lifetime are calculated and convetted to seconds
..- Leap years are subtracted from total years
..- If the user's age in years is under 4, they are informed of the fact that they are not old enough to be typing on a computer yet :)

**Hello** uses:
..- Loops
..- Type conversion
..- Conditions
..- Variables

I hope this is a fun and helpful project for you to look at, especially if like me, you are just starting your Ruby journey.
Thanks for looking!
